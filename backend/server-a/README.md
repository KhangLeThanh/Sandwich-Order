# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

For communicating with RabbitMQ, there are many possible approaches. In the rabbit-utils-directory, in receiveTask.js and sendTask.js files, you can see simple examples of code that can be integrated into Swagger server stub's Order-controller. These have been directly copied from RabbitMQ examples, and can be improved a lot for this system.

### Running the server
To run the server, run:

```
npm start
```

To view the Swagger UI interface:

```
open http://localhost:8080/docs
```

This project leverages the mega-awesome [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.
