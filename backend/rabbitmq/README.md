# RabbitMQ

This directory is for the code and documentation of the _RabbitMQ_.

Unlike with th Node servers, getting started with RabbitMQ doesn't require a Dockerfile and building an image, but you can use the RabbitMQ images from Docker Hub, and use them in the docker-compose.yml.

When your project progresses, you can add a Dockerfile and other needed files, if you need them.
